/*
 * The Java do-while loop is used to iterate a part of the program repeatedly,
 * until the specified condition is true. If the number of iteration is not
 * fixed and you must have to execute the loop at least once, it is recommended
 * to use a do-while loop.
 * 
 * Java do-while loop is called an exit control loop. Therefore, unlike while
 * loop and for loop, the do-while check the condition at the end of loop body.
 * The Java do-while loop is executed at least once because condition is checked
 * after loop body.
