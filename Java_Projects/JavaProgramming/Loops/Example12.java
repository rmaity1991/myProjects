/*
 * The continue statement is used in loop control structure when you need to
 * jump to the next iteration of the loop immediately. It can be used with for
 * loop or while loop.
 * 
 * The Java continue statement is used to continue the loop. It continues the
 * current flow of the program and skips the remaining code at the specified
 * condition. In case of an inner loop, it continues the inner loop only.
 * 
 * We can use Java continue statement in all types of loops such as for loop,
 * while loop and do-while loop.
